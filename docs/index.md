## Get Started

Install the plugins through [Obsidian Community](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-mkdocs-publisher) or, if you prefer to, through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). 

Configure Enveloppe as described [here](https://enveloppe.ovh/Getting%20Started/Plugin/) or learn how to [contribute back](https://enveloppe.ovh/Getting%20Started/Developing/) to the project.

> [!warning] Do NOT use Enveloppe to publish from *within* the Vault directory structure. If you do, the upload process will corrupt your files! This module is not intended for this type of workflow.
