title: Friend & Alternatives
---

There are some alternatives to Enveloppe. Some only supports some wiki distribution (Mkdocs, Quartz, etc.), while others are more general. Here is a list of some of them:
- [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish): The official solution from Obsidian, but it is not free and does not support all the features of Enveloppe.
- [Obsidian Digitial Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/): The inspiration for Enveloppe. Use it own wiki distribution and doesn't support all options of Enveloppe (mainly folder and files tree).
- [Quartz Syncer](https://saberzero1.github.io/quartz-syncer-docs/) : Sync to Quartz. Support dataview, allows to set up the template (theming feature), a specific vault folder and is not desktop only! It is based on Digital Garden with all of the features (like the cool publication center I didn't replicated.)
